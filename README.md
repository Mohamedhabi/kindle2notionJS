# kindle2notionTS:
Welcome to **kindle2notionTS**, your ultimate tool for synchronizing Kindle notes and highlights into a well-organized Notion template.

The template is inspired from [@elizabethfilips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bxpsvcW2mc) and [@aliabdaal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjoxkxM_I5g).

This tool utilizes the `My Clippings.txt` file extracted from your Kindle, containing all your notes and highlights.
# The notion template briefly:
We have a dataset of books, when clicking on each book, we can write its summery and other information, and see all the notes taken for that book.
![library_books](./images/library_books.png)
![book_highlights](./images/book_highlights.png)
We have a dataset of highlights, each linked to a book, and each of them represents a page.

Each highlight is a sync block, that is synchronized with 'All notes' in the book page. If you do any modification to your note it will automaticly synchronize with all other sync blocks refrencing it.
